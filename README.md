# wine-quality-prediction
* buit an end to end machine learning model to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties

* performed data cleaning, preprocessing and transformation to prepare the dataset for modeling

* applid feature scaling and selection techniques to imporove model accuracy and stability

* checked the all root mean squaring value by applying different types of machine learning algorithm
  like Randomforestregressor,linearregression

  the linearregression have value  0.43

  and the Randomforestregressor have value 0.046
 
*  with lower rmse value we used Randomforestregressor as an machine learning algorithm

*  TECHNIQUES THAT USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS IS

   -PANDAS

   -NUMPY

   -MATPLOTLIB
 
   -SCIKITLRARN

   -JUPYTERLAB

* AT the end predicted dataset is compared with the original dataset by using scatter graph
