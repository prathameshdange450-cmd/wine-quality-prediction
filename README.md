# wine-quality-prediction
Designed and implemented an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict wine quality based on physicochemical attributes. The project involved comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering to improve data quality and model performance. Multiple supervised learning algorithms were trained, evaluated, and compared using standard performance metrics to identify the most effective model. The solution demonstrates strong analytical skills, practical application of machine learning techniques, and proficiency in Python-based data science tools.
